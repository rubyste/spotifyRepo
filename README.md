# Spotify Songs Genre Segmentation

## Project Description

This project implements a music recommendation system inspired by Spotify. It analyzes the songs and artists you usually listen to and groups them into clusters based on comparable features. These clusters help understand the auditory properties of diverse songs. The system uses a dataset (`spotify dataset.csv`) to build an automated recommendation system.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
* Scikit-learn (for clustering)
* VS Code

## Features / Modules

* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
* **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Generate plots to understand the data and feature correlations.
* **Clustering:** Group songs into clusters based on features like playlist, genre, and other attributes.
* **Recommendation Output:** Build and show the final results for a recommendation system.
